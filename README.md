1.Explain the differences between primitive and reference data types
 In programming, data types determine the kind of values that can be stored and manipulated in variables. The two main categories of data types are primitive data types and reference data types. Here are the key differences between them:
1.	Definition:
•	Primitive Data Types: Primitive data types are basic building blocks provided by the programming language. They are predefined and directly supported by the language itself. Examples include integers, floating-point numbers, characters, Booleans, etc.
•	Reference Data Types: Reference data types, also known as object types, are derived from classes or structures defined in a programming language. They are created by the programmer and can have various properties and behaviors. Examples include arrays, strings, classes, interfaces, etc.
2.	Memory Allocation:
•	Primitive Data Types: Primitive data types are stored directly in memory and occupy a fixed amount of space. They are usually allocated on the stack memory.
•	Reference Data Types: Reference data types store a reference or address to the memory location where the actual data is stored. The data itself is allocated on the heap memory. The reference variable occupies space on the stack, but the actual data resides on the heap.
3.	Assignment and Comparison:
•	Primitive Data Types: Primitive data types are assigned by value, meaning the actual value is copied from one variable to another. When comparing primitive data types, the values are compared directly.
•	Reference Data Types: Reference data types are assigned by reference, meaning the reference to the memory location is copied from one variable to another. It does not create a new copy of the data. When comparing reference data types, the references are compared, not the actual data.
4.	Default Values:
•	Primitive Data Types: Primitive data types have default values if not explicitly initialized. For example, integers default to 0, booleans default to false, etc.
•	Reference Data Types: Reference data types have a default value of null if not explicitly initialized. Null means the reference does not point to any valid object.
5.	Operations and Methods:
•	Primitive Data Types: Primitive data types have predefined operations and mathematical operations directly supported by the programming language. They do not have methods or properties associated with them.
•	Reference Data Types: Reference data types can have methods and properties associated with them. These methods can be called to perform operations or retrieve information related to the object.
Understanding the differences between primitive and reference data types is crucial when it comes to memory management, assignment behavior, and understanding how values are stored and manipulated in a programming language.
2.	Define the scope of a variable (hint: local and global variable)
The scope of a variable refers to the portion of a program where the variable can be accessed and manipulated. In programming, there are two main types of variable scope: local scope and global scope.
1.	Local Variable Scope:
•	Local variables are declared within a specific block of code, such as a function or a loop.
•	They are accessible only within the block in which they are declared, and their scope is limited to that specific block.
•	Local variables are typically used to store temporary or intermediate values that are relevant only within the block of code where they are defined.
•	Once the execution flow exits the block in which the local variable is defined, the variable ceases to exist, and its value cannot be accessed anymore.
•	Each invocation of a block creates a new instance of local variables with separate memory locations.
Example of local variable scope in Python:
python
def my_function(): x = 10 # Local variable print(x) my_function() # Prints 10 print(x) # Error: x is not defined 
2.	Global Variable Scope:
•	Global variables are declared outside of any specific block of code, usually at the top level of a program.
•	They are accessible from anywhere within the program, including inside functions, loops, or other blocks.
•	Global variables are often used to store information that needs to be accessed by multiple parts of the program.
•	Once a global variable is declared, it retains its value throughout the execution of the program, unless explicitly modified.
•	Global variables should be used judiciously to avoid naming conflicts or unintended modifications.
Example of global variable scope in Python:
python
x = 10 # Global variable def my_function(): print(x) my_function() # Prints 10 print(x) # Prints 10 
In summary, the scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed and manipulated within a program. Local variables have a limited scope within a specific block of code, while global variables can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
3. Why is initialization of variables required. 
Initialization of variables is required in programming to assign an initial value to a variable before it is used in any calculations or operations. Initialization ensures that the variable has a known and defined value at the beginning of its scope. Here are a few reasons why initialization of variables is important:
1.	Avoiding Unexpected Behavior: If a variable is not initialized and used without a value, it may contain a random or garbage value from the memory location it occupies. Using such uninitialized variables can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results in the program.
2.	Predictable and Consistent Results: Initialization provides consistency and predictability in the behavior of variables. By assigning a specific initial value, you establish a known starting point for the variable, which helps in making calculations and performing operations reliably.
3.	Preventing Bugs and Errors: Uninitialized variables can introduce bugs and errors in a program. They can lead to logical errors, calculation errors, or cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly. By initializing variables, you reduce the chances of such errors and make your code more robust.
4.	Enforcing Readability and Maintainability: Initializing variables explicitly improves the readability and maintainability of code. When a variable is initialized at the point of declaration, it becomes clear to other programmers or yourself what the expected starting value of the variable is. It makes the code easier to understand, modify, and debug.
5.	Ensuring Proper Memory Allocation: Initialization helps in ensuring proper memory allocation for variables. Depending on the programming language, variables may occupy memory space, and initialization ensures that the correct amount of memory is allocated for the variable's data type.
Overall, initialization of variables is a good programming practice that promotes code clarity, reduces bugs, and ensures predictable and reliable behavior of variables in a program. It is essential to initialize variables before using them to maintain program correctness and integrity.
4. Differentiate between static, instance and local variables.
Static, instance, and local variables are different types of variables used in programming. Here are their key differences:
1.	Static Variables:
•	Scope: Static variables are associated with the class itself rather than with individual instances (objects) of the class. They are shared among all instances of the class.
•	Declaration: Static variables are declared using the static keyword within a class.
•	Memory Allocation: Static variables are stored in a fixed memory location throughout the execution of the program.
•	Lifetime: Static variables persist throughout the lifespan of the program.
•	Initialization: Static variables are typically initialized once at the beginning of the program or when they are first accessed.
•	Usage: Static variables are useful for maintaining global state or shared data between different instances of a class or within a class itself.
2.	Instance Variables:
•	Scope: Instance variables are associated with each individual instance (object) of a class. Each instance has its own copy of instance variables.
•	Declaration: Instance variables are declared within a class but outside of any methods or functions.
•	Memory Allocation: Memory for instance variables is allocated separately for each instance of the class.
•	Lifetime: Instance variables exist as long as the instance of the class exists. They are created when an object is instantiated and are destroyed when the object is garbage-collected.
•	Initialization: Instance variables are usually initialized within the constructor of the class or assigned values directly.
•	Usage: Instance variables hold the state or attributes of an object. They represent the unique characteristics or data associated with each instance of a class.
3.	Local Variables:
•	Scope: Local variables are declared and used within a specific block, method, or function. They are only accessible within that block.
•	Declaration: Local variables are declared within a method, loop, or block of code.
•	Memory Allocation: Memory for local variables is allocated on the stack when the block of code is executed and deallocated when the block is exited.
•	Lifetime: Local variables exist only within the scope of the block in which they are defined. They are created when the block is entered and destroyed when the block is exited.
•	Initialization: Local variables must be explicitly initialized before they are used.
•	Usage: Local variables are used for temporary storage within a block of code. They hold intermediate values or data that is relevant only to the specific block or method.
Understanding the differences between static, instance, and local variables is important for proper variable usage, memory management, and ensuring that data is stored and accessed correctly within a program.

5.Differentiate between widening and narrowing casting in java
 In Java, casting refers to the process of converting a value of one data type to another. There are two types of casting: widening (implicit) casting and narrowing (explicit) casting. Here's how they differ:
1.	Widening Casting:
•	Also known as implicit casting or upcasting.
•	Occurs when you assign a value of a smaller data type to a variable of a larger data type.
•	Java automatically performs the casting without requiring any explicit syntax.
•	No loss of information occurs because you are converting to a larger data type.
•	Examples:
int num1 = 10;
double num2 = num1;  // Widening casting from int to double
2.	Narrowing Casting:
•	Also known as explicit casting or downcasting.
•	Occurs when you assign a value of a larger data type to a variable of a smaller data type.
•	Requires explicit casting using parentheses and the target data type.
•	There is a potential loss of information or precision during narrowing casting, and it may result in data truncation or unexpected behavior.
•	Examples:
double num1 = 10.5;
int num2 = (int) num1;  // Narrowing casting from double to int
It's important to note that narrowing casting can result in data loss or unexpected results if the value being casted cannot be fully represented in the smaller data type. Java provides explicit narrowing casting to ensure that you are aware of the potential loss of precision or information.
In general, widening casting is safe and happens implicitly, while narrowing casting requires explicit syntax and should be used with caution, considering the potential loss of information.




7.Define package as used in java programming
In Java programming, a package is a way to organize and group related classes, interfaces, and sub-packages. It provides a hierarchical structure for organizing code and helps in avoiding naming conflicts between classes with the same name in different packages.
8.	Explain the importance of using Java packages 
Using Java packages is important for several reasons:
1.	Organization and Modularity: Packages provide a way to organize and structure your codebase. By grouping related classes and interfaces into packages, you can create a clear and logical organization of your code. This improves code readability, makes it easier to navigate and understand the codebase, and allows for modular development.
2.	Namespace Management: Packages help in avoiding naming conflicts between classes. Since classes in different packages can have the same name, the package name serves as a namespace qualifier. This allows you to use descriptive and meaningful class names without worrying about name clashes with classes from other packages.
3.	Encapsulation and Access Control: Packages allow you to control the visibility and access to classes and interfaces within a package. Classes and interfaces with default (package-private) access are only accessible within the same package. This helps in encapsulating implementation details and allows you to define the intended usage and API boundaries for your code.
4.	Code Reusability: Packages facilitate code reusability. By organizing related classes and interfaces into packages, you can create reusable components or libraries. Other developers can then import and use these packages in their own projects, saving development time and effort.
5.	Dependency Management: Packages enable dependency management in Java. By specifying package dependencies, you can define the relationships between different modules or components of your application. This helps in managing and resolving dependencies during compilation and runtime.
6.	Collaboration and Teamwork: Packages provide a logical unit for collaboration and teamwork. Different team members can work on separate packages without interfering with each other's code. Packages also allow for better code sharing and integration between different parts of a project developed by different teams or individuals.
7.	Code Maintainability: Well-structured and organized code is easier to maintain and update. By using packages, you create a modular and scalable architecture that makes it simpler to add new features, modify existing functionality, or fix bugs. It improves code maintainability and reduces the chances of introducing unintended side effects.

Section 2:
1.	Write a Java program that asks the user to enter their sur name and current age then print the number of characters of their sir name and even or odd depending on their age number. 
Example of Expected result:
If sir name is Saruni and age is 29, output will be;
then the number of characters is 6.
Your current age is an odd number

import java.util.Scanner;

public class SurnameAndAge {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Ask user to enter their surname
        System.out.print("Enter your surname: ");
        String surname = scanner.nextLine();

        // Ask user to enter their age
        System.out.print("Enter your current age: ");
        int age = scanner.nextInt();

        // Calculate and print the number of characters in the surname
        int surnameLength = surname.length();
        System.out.println("The number of characters in your surname is: " + surnameLength);

        // Determine if the age is even or odd and print the result
        String ageStatus = (age % 2 == 0) ? "even" : "odd";
        System.out.println("Your current age is an " + ageStatus + " number");

        scanner.close();
    }
}
